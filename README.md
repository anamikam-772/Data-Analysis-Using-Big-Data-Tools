## 🔄 Data Processing Workflow
1. Loaded multiple datasets into **PySpark DataFrames**
2. Defined **custom schemas** for structured ingestion
3. Performed **data profiling and cleansing**
   - Removed nulls
   - Handled unknown values
4. Joined multiple datasets into a **single unified dataset**
5. Stored final datasets in **Hive tables** with partitioning

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
### 1. Logistic Regression
- Used for binary classification
- Accuracy: **~90.8%**
- Recall: **~95.0%**

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
- Improved performance over Logistic Regression
- Accuracy: **~91.6%**
- Recall: **~93.0%**

📌 **Conclusion:**  
The Decision Tree model performed better than Logistic Regression for the given dataset.
